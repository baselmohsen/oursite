    <h2>Recommendations for Managing Pneumonia</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Follow Antibiotic Treatment:</strong> If pneumonia is caused by bacteria, follow the antibiotic treatment prescribed by your healthcare provider. Finish the entire course of antibiotics even if you start feeling better.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, herbal tea, and broth, to stay hydrated and help loosen mucus in your lungs.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Plenty of Rest:</strong> Rest is essential for your body to recover from pneumonia. Avoid strenuous activities and get plenty of sleep to support your immune system.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Humidifier:</strong> Using a humidifier or taking steamy showers can help moisten the air and ease breathing, especially if you have chest congestion.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Fever and Pain:</strong> Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to reduce fever and alleviate pain and discomfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Good Respiratory Hygiene:</strong> Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing to prevent the spread of pneumonia-causing germs.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Home:</strong> If you have pneumonia, it's important to stay home and avoid close contact with others to prevent spreading the infection.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow Up with Your Healthcare Provider:</strong> Attend follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider to monitor your recovery and ensure that your pneumonia is resolving as expected.</li>
        <li><strong>Quit Smoking:</strong> If you smoke, quitting smoking can help improve your lung health and reduce the risk of pneumonia-related complications.</li>
        <li><strong>Vaccination:</strong> Consider getting vaccinated against pneumonia, especially if you are at higher risk due to age, chronic illness, or other factors. Vaccines such as the pneumococcal vaccine can help prevent certain types of pneumonia.</li>
    </ul>
